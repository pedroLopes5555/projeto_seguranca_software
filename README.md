# Project

C# web api whit sqlserver database (docker)

database will store the users and hashed password

this soluction should work whit any standart library OAuth



### User Authentication:

You provide your credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server.

The server verifies these credentials.

### Token Issuance:
 
Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT).

This JWT is digitally signed using the server's private key.

The signed JWT is then sent back to your client application.


### Client Stores the Token:

Your client application stores this JWT, typically in memory or local storage.

For subsequent requests to backend services, the client includes this JWT in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.

### Backend Service Verification:

When the backend service receives a request with the JWT, it needs to verify the token's authenticity.‚Äã

To do this, the backend retrieves the public key corresponding to the authentication server's private key.

This public key is often made available through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint provided by the authentication server.

Using this public key, the backend service verifies the JWT's signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with and is indeed issued by the trusted authentication server.



## JWT
for the jwt the ideia is to use a private/public key pair, for the jwt token validation
To verify a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RS256), you need the public key corresponding to the private key that signed the token. This public key is typically provided by the token issuer through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint




# üîë Core Features

    Client Registration

        Ability to register OAuth clients (with client_id, client_secret, redirect_uris, scopes, etc.)

    Authorization Endpoint (/authorize)

        Handles requests for the Authorization Code flow.

        Presents a login screen for the user and asks for consent to authorize scopes.

    Token Endpoint (/token)

        Handles:

            Authorization Code exchange (grant_type=authorization_code)

            Client Credentials (grant_type=client_credentials)

            Refresh Tokens (grant_type=refresh_token)

            Password Grant (optional and deprecated)

    User Authentication

        Login UI or API (e.g., form-based, external identity provider).

        Issue authorization codes or tokens on successful login.

    Token Generation

        Generate and sign access tokens (typically JWTs).

        Optional: Refresh tokens, ID tokens (if doing OpenID Connect).

    Token Validation

        Endpoint to validate tokens (/introspect or via JWT signature).

        Public keys (/.well-known/openid-configuration and /jwks) if JWTs are used.

    Scope & Consent Management

        Ability to define and manage scopes.

        User consent screen to authorize scopes requested by clients.

    Secure Storage

        Store:

            Clients

            Users

            Authorization Codes

            Access/Refresh Tokens

            Scopes

    Token Revocation (/revoke)

        Allow clients to revoke access or refresh tokens.





## ‚úÖ Step 1: Developer Submits Registration Form

In your app (admin panel, dev portal, API), the developer provides:

    App name

    Redirect URIs

    App type (confidential/public)

    Allowed scopes or APIs

    Logo, website (optional)

## üîê Step 2: Server Generates Credentials

Your backend generates:

    A unique client_id (GUID, hash, or slug)

    A secure client_secret (only if the client is confidential)

    Persists the info in the database

        Table: OAuthClients

        Columns: id, secret, name, type, redirect_uris, etc.




## üîè Step 3: Your Server Enforces the Rules

From now on, whenever this client tries to:

    Start an auth flow (via /authorize)

    Request tokens (via /token)

    Refresh tokens

    Access protected APIs

Your server will:

    Verify their client_id and (if confidential) their client_secret.

    Check if the requested redirect URI, scopes, and flow are allowed.

    Generate tokens accordingly.
